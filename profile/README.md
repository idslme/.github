## Exposome and Human Health
Exposome is the totality of all exposures that we encounter during our life. Chemicals are the main component of the exposome. There can be thousands of chemicals that we are exposed to in our daily life. Some of them, such as hormones are generated by our own body, and some, such as phthalates or [PFAS](https://www.epa.gov/pfas) are introduced by the consumer industry. To monitor these exposures, our body's samples, such as blood, urine, stool, hair, nails, saliva can be analyzed using advanced machines such as mass spectrometry that can measure thousands of chemicals in a snapshot. These machines can generate mountains of data in a matter of hours for a single person's samples. One of the key challenges we are facing is to interpret these data in the context of human diseases and prioritized and novel chemical exposures.

IDSL.ME team develops software, databases and novel approaches to analyze and interpret metabolomics and exposomics datasets in population-scale studies.
More details about the group's research and resources can be found at this [IDSL.ME](https://www.idsl.me/). The group is part of the Department of Environmental Medicine and Public Health, [EMPH](https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments/environmental-public-health) and the [Institute of Exposomics Research](https://mountsinaiexposomics.org/) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, [ISMMS](https://icahn.mssm.edu/), New York, USA.
